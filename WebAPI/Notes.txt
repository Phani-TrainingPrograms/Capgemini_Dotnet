ASP.NET Web API
If I want a set of functions to be consumed from different platforms and languages, then we can go for REST API.
REST stands for Representational State Transfer. 
It implies that the data can be transfered in the form of JSON/XML using HTTP. 
HTTP has 5 verbs: 
GET-> Extracting the data from the services
POST->Send the Data in a hidden format to the service, 
PUT->Send the data to update the data in the service.
DELETE->Remove the data from the Service
PATCH->Perform partial updates in the service. 
 
How is it different from DLL?
DLLs are available only on Windows Apps. DLLs are inproc components. Where as Web API is a part of Web services. 

Other technologies similar to Web API"
SpringBoot ->Java
Express ->Nodejs
CodeIgniter ->PHP
and many more for different technologies. 

.NET Web API can be developed on both .NET Framework and .NET CORE.
Our example is on .NET CORE.

The Major features of Web API:
1. Built in .NET CORE to create RESTFul Services.
2. Light weight and faster compared to WCF(Older SOA of .NET)
3. DI feature of .NET CORE.
4. Good support of new libraries that can be taken from Nuget.
